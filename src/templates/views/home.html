      1)the gulpFile.js has the configuration of gulp.<br> 
      2) the src folder has js folder where the main.js file is present there i have created a intercepter
        which has an authorisation header where a sample text is included in 
        which i have checked whether the request authorisation has same with response authorisation or not.
        For that i have printed a console where i have printed request authorisation
        and response authorisation as well. 
        For cross verification you have to open the network and find the request and
        response headers for main.js <br>
      3) For internationalizaton i have used date,currency and number,and for that 
       i have included india's locale.js file. <br> 
      4) For controller i have created HomeCtrl.js which is under src/js/contollers
